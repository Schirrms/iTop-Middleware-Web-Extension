# iTop-Middleware-Web-Extension
Some custom extensions for the Web and Middleware iTop classes - add also a Web Proxy role

## Goal

Probably very 'Custom specific', this extension aims to adds :

To 'Web Server', a notion of 'Project', 'Usage' (Prod, preprod..), and 'Zone' (Internet, Intranet, Extranet...)

Add a specific kind of Web instance : Proxy

To Middleware, adds the sames fields as Web Server

To Middleware instance, add a port number, an URI (ie the path of the middleware in a 'web aspect'), and an URL.

## Status

Empty shell at this time !

## Dependencies

At least iTop in version 2.6.0 ! And, most probably some other custom extensions (for the project and the usage field)

## Installation

As for all my extentions, just download the zip file, and copy the 'schirrms-...' directory in your extensions directory, then rerun the setup as usual.
